# Branch name convention

### Category

- **feature**: is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- **bugfix**: is for fixing a bug
- **hotfix**: is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
- **test**: is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket
- **docs**: is for writing, updating, or fixing documentation

### Description

After the category, there should be a "/" followed by a description which sums up the purpose of this specific branch. This description should be short and "kebab-cased".

### Examples:

- You need to add, refactor or remove a feature: **`git branch feature/create-new-button-component`**
- You need to fix a bug: **`git branch bugfix/button-overlap-form-on-mobile`**
- You need to fix a bug really fast (possibly with a temporary solution): **`git branch hotfix/registration-form-not-working`**
- You need to experiment outside of an issue/ticket: **`git branch test/refactor-components-with-atomic-design`**
- You need to update documentations **`git branch docs/update-readme`**

# Commit name convention

### Category

- **feat**: is for adding a new feature
- **fix**: is for fixing a bug
- **refactor**: is for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose (e.g. readibility)
- **chore**: is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.)

After the category, there should be a ":" announcing the commit description.

### Description

After the colon, the commit description should consist in short statements describing the changes.

Each statement should start with a verb conjugated in an imperative way. Statements should be seperated from themselves with a ";".

### Examples:

- **`git commit -m 'feat: add new button component; add new button components to templates'`**
- **`git commit -m 'fix: add the stop directive to button component to prevent propagation'`**
- **`git commit -m 'refactor: rewrite button component in TypeScript'`**
- **`git commit -m 'chore: write button documentation'`**
